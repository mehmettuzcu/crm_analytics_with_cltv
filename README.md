I learned about CRM analytics within the scope of Veri Bilimi Okulu DSMLBC course. I applied what I learned to a dataset.

Business Problem
An e-commerce site wants a forward-looking projection for customer actions according to the CLTV values of its customers.

Dataset Story
The data set  Online Retail II includes the sales of a UK-based online sales store between 01/12/2009 - 09/12/2011.  The product catalog of this company includes souvenirs.
